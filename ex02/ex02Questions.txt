Question 1:  Review the options under Build Triggers.  Why might you want to set up your build to trigger "after other projects are built" or use a GitHub webhook to poll git?
Answer:  For running a test after a build is complete.  This configuration complements the "Build other projects" section in the "Post-build Actions" of an upstream project, but is preferable when you want to configure the downstream project. 

Question 2:  Review the options under Build Environment.  Why might you want to delete the workspace before the build starts?  
Answer:  To clean up space on the file system and to clear work history when it's not important to keep.

Question 3:  Where will the script we specified run when the build job is executed?  (Recall that this is a dockerized Jenkins instance)
Answer:  Jenkins Image
